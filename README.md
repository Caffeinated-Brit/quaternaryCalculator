To use this calculator, the user simlpy clicks the buttons they need for a function. The calculator can do the following: addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, square rooting, and squaring. 
The calculator also provides the use of a backspace and clear button to change misinputs or start over. 

Note: To use the square and square root buttons correctly, the user must input the number they wish to use the function on THEN press the function button. An example of what the square root function
looks like implemented can be seen below.
